# AUDIT.md — Critical Correctness Audit Protocol

> **Read this file in full before every audit run.** No skim reads.
> Also read every source file you audit in full — no excerpts, no spot reads.

---

## Goal

Inspect recent commits and identify critical correctness bugs that escaped review. Only surface issues that would cause:

- data loss or corruption
- crashes in critical paths
- security holes (auth bypass, permission escalation, secret leakage)
- significant user-facing breakage (the user can't complete a core flow)

This is **not** a code review for style, taste, or theoretical concerns. The bar is intentionally high: "could this hurt a real user, today?"

---

## Investigation strategy

- **Focus on behavioral changes with meaningful blast radius.** Skip pure docs, types-only commits, CSS, dependency bumps that don't change behavior.
- **Look for:**
  - data corruption
  - race conditions that lose writes
  - null dereferences in critical paths
  - auth / permission bypasses
  - infinite loops
  - resource leaks (memory, DB connections, API budget)
  - silent data truncation
- **Trace the full code path** — don't pattern-match on the diff. Understand the caller chain and downstream effects. Open the file the diff lives in. Read it from top to bottom. Then open every file it imports from that you don't already have memorised. Read those in full too.
- **Ignore:**
  - style issues
  - minor edge cases
  - theoretical concerns without a concrete trigger
  - low-severity issues that merely degrade UX
  - bugs that pre-date the audit window (those go in the regular punch list, not the audit log)

---

## Confidence bar

- You **must** be able to describe a concrete scenario that triggers the bug — who does what, in what order, with what data, on what device — that produces the bad outcome.
- If you cannot construct a plausible trigger scenario, **do not flag it**. Note it in the regular punch list if it's worth tracking, but do not add it to the audit log as a finding.
- "It's theoretically unsafe" is not a finding. "User A logged in, opens CV with cvId=X owned by user B, the route fetches and returns user B's data" is a finding.

---

## Cost & efficiency

- When fixing a bug with multiple correct options, pick the **cheapest correct one**. Cheapest = least new code, least new dependency, least runtime cost, least operational complexity.
- When reading the diff, **flag any cheaper-or-equivalent alternative** you spot. Examples:
  - JOIN instead of N+1 round-trips
  - one query with `.in()` instead of a loop
  - cached / memoised value instead of fresh fetch
  - server-side computation instead of client roundtrip (or vice versa, when payload size flips the equation)
  - smaller Anthropic model (Haiku vs Sonnet) for trivial classification prompts
  - native string ops instead of regex when the input shape is fixed
  - early return instead of nested conditional
- A flag isn't a bug. Bugs go in **Findings**. Cost/efficiency notes go in **Notes for follow-up** in the log entry.

---

## Fix strategy (if a bug is found)

- Implement a **minimal, high-confidence fix.** No drive-by refactors, no related cleanup.
- **Add or update tests** to lock in the fixed behaviour. The test must fail against the unfixed code and pass against the fix — verify both directions.
- Keep the fix scoped to one bug. One PR / one commit per finding.

---

## Safety rules

- **Do not push to `main` without explicit approval, even for a fix.** Fixes go on a feature branch (e.g. `audit/fix-2026-05-04-keyword-coach-check`). Open a PR if/when we move to PR-based flow; until then, present the diff and wait for the user's "go".
- **Do not open a PR** without an approved finding + fix. Reporting in chat is the default; PR comes after the user approves the fix.
- If no critical bug is found, the expected output is a short **"no critical bugs found"** entry in the log. **This is the expected outcome on most days.** Don't manufacture findings to look productive.

---

## Output format

Append a new section to **`## Log`** below. One section per audit run.

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <commit-range>

**Scope:** N commits, M files touched, summary of what shipped in the window.
**Result:** No critical bugs found. | One finding (P0/P1). | Two findings…

**Findings (if any):**
- **Bug:** what it is
- **Impact:** who is affected, how badly
- **Trigger scenario:** concrete steps
- **Root cause:** why
- **Fix:** what we did, on which branch
- **Validation:** tests added, test command, what was verified

**Notes for follow-up (cost/efficiency, non-blocking):**
- One-line items that aren't bugs but should reach the regular punch list.
```

---

## Pre-push enforcement

A pre-push git hook (`.githooks/pre-push`) refuses any push to `main` if today's date does not appear under `## Log`. This makes "ran the audit today" a hard precondition for shipping. The hook is installed automatically by `npm install` via the `postinstall` script.

If today's diff is doc-only or test-only and you've decided no audit is needed, add an explicit log entry like:

```markdown
### 2026-05-04 — docs-only

**Scope:** doc updates, no behavioural diff.
**Result:** No audit required.
```

That counts as today's entry and unblocks the push.

## Log

### 2026-05-04 — Sprint 0d setup (this commit)

**Scope:** This file and the pre-push hook were added. No behavioural diff in the application code.
**Result:** No audit required for the setup commit itself. First real audit follows immediately on `e0775c3..HEAD` (the AI burst window).

### 2026-05-04 — `e0775c3..HEAD` (AI burst, ~14 days)

**Scope:** 16 commits in the window. Behavioural surface: 4 new AI API routes (`profile`, `description`, `skills`, `keywords`), `AIToggle` component + `useAIMode` hook, `KeywordMatchPanel` component, AI integration into `ProfileTextForm`, `ExperienceForm`, `SkillsLanguagesForm`. The two most recent commits (`3de2725` docs, `39a039d` Sprint 0c tests) had no behavioural diff and were skipped.

**Files read in full:** `app/api/ai/profile/route.ts`, `app/api/ai/description/route.ts`, `app/api/ai/skills/route.ts`, `app/api/ai/keywords/route.ts`, `components/cv/AIToggle.tsx`, `components/cv/KeywordMatchPanel.tsx`, `components/cv/ProfileTextForm.tsx`, AI handlers in `ExperienceForm.tsx` and `SkillsLanguagesForm.tsx`, `lib/queries/cv.ts` (called by every AI route), `lib/guest/storage.ts`, RLS policies for `cvs` in `supabase/migrations/20260314_initial_schema.sql`.

**Result: No critical bugs found.** Auth paths are correctly gated (server-side `auth.getUser()` + ownership check by `user_id`), coach access on `/api/ai/keywords` enforces `coach_links` explicitly on top of RLS (defence in depth), Anthropic SDK key is server-side only, all API routes have try/catch returning generic Swedish messages without leaking DB/SDK error text. Form-side AI calls use `AbortController` with a 15s timeout and disable the trigger button while in flight.

**Lower-severity items (logged for visibility, not P0/P1):**

1. **Silent data truncation: guest skill suggestions ignore experiences and educations.** `components/cv/SkillsLanguagesForm.tsx:177` builds the AISkillsPayload guest branch with `experiences: []` and `educations: []` hard-coded, even though `loadGuestCV()` has the real arrays in localStorage. The form's parent (`GuestStepContent`) doesn't thread them in either. A guest who has filled in their CV gets generic skills (e.g. "kommunikation", "samarbete") instead of context-aware ones (e.g. "Truckkort B", "ADR-utbildning").
   - **Trigger scenario:** guest fills `job_title="Truckförare"`, `program="Yrkesgymnasium"`, goes to step 5, toggles AI on, clicks "Föreslå kompetenser" → request goes out with empty experience/education arrays → AI suggestions are generic.
   - **Why not P0/P1:** AI is opt-in (off by default), labelled "prompt under utveckling" in the UI, and the user can still complete and export their CV. No data loss, no auth issue, no crash. The user simply gets a worse AI experience than an authenticated user would for the same input. Fits the AUDIT.md focus list under "silent data truncation" but at low severity.
   - **Suggested fix (small, single PR):** thread `guestCV.experiences` and `guestCV.educations` from `GuestStepContent` into `SkillsLanguagesForm` as new optional props; use them when building the guest payload. ~5 lines. Skips a test for now — locking this in needs jsdom + RTL which Sprint 0c deliberately deferred. Covered by a manual test plan instead.

2. **`message.content[0].type` access in all four AI routes** assumes the content array is non-empty. If Anthropic ever returns a response with `content: []` (e.g. tool-use or refusal blocks only) the access throws. The throw is caught by the route's try/catch and the user sees `'AI-tjänsten svarade inte. Försök igen.'`. So: not a crash to the app, just a generic error to the user. Future-proof: replace `message.content[0].type === 'text' ? ... : ''` with `message.content.find(b => b.type === 'text')?.text ?? ''`. Cheaper than the current code in failure cases too.

3. **`KeywordMatchPanel` parses `JSON.parse(data.result)` and trusts it's a `AIKeywordSuggestion[]`**. If the model wraps the JSON in prose or returns an object instead of an array, the subsequent `.map` throws and the React error boundary catches it. Same severity profile as #2 — degraded UX, no critical breakage. Defensive parse + shape check would close this.

**Notes for follow-up (cost/efficiency, non-blocking):**

- **Prompt caching is not enabled.** All four routes pass system prompts of 300–500 tokens on every call without `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }`. For Sonnet 4.6 the cache write is 25% surcharge and the read is 10% of full price; for users hitting the same prompt repeatedly within a session, this is a clean cost win. Worth pairing with the Sprint 1 rate-limiting work.
- **`/api/ai/skills` is a simple "given X, suggest 6 names" task.** Currently uses `claude-sonnet-4-6` like the others. `claude-haiku-4-5` would likely produce equal-quality output at roughly a quarter of the cost. Worth A/B-ing the prompts before changing.
- **No request-size cap on user-supplied AI inputs.** A misbehaving client could POST a 5 MB `currentSummary` and burn tokens up to whatever Anthropic's request-size limit is. Combined with the known no-rate-limit gap (Sprint 1 P0), this is exposure. Adding a `max length: 5000` cap server-side on `currentSummary`, `currentDescription`, `jobPosting` is one line per route.
- **`getFullCV` does 10 round-trips in parallel.** Fine for a single CV today; worth flagging if any future caller fans out across many CVs (e.g. coach dashboard rendering CV cards) — would need a JOIN-based query to avoid N×10.

**Validation performed:** Read every file listed above top-to-bottom (no excerpts). Cross-referenced auth flow against `lib/queries/cv.ts` and the `cvs` RLS policies. Did not modify production code in this run. No tests added (no fix applied).

### 2026-05-05 — `35ce873..HEAD`

**Scope:** 6 commits in the window, 4 with behavioural diff. (1) AI rate-limit infra: per-user hourly cap (50/hr) backed by `ai_request_log` table, applied to all four AI routes; input-size caps via `findOversizedField()`; defensive `message.content.find(b => b.type === 'text')` extraction. (2) Forgot-password / reset-password flow: new server actions `requestPasswordReset` and `updatePassword`, two new pages, two new form components, login form notice on `?reset=success`. (3) Cookie-marker fix for Supabase whitelist compatibility (drops `?next=` query, uses `cv_reset_pending` cookie). (4) Today's pure refactor extracting cookie helpers into `lib/auth/cookies.ts`. Skipped: `cfb98e2` (docs-only), `545e1b8` (gen-only types + the migration itself, audited semantically as part of `ce7d6cc`).

**Files read in full:** `app/api/ai/profile/route.ts`, `app/api/ai/description/route.ts`, `app/api/ai/skills/route.ts`, `app/api/ai/keywords/route.ts`, `lib/ai/rate-limit.ts`, `lib/ai/limits.ts`, `lib/ai/rate-limit.test.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260504_ai_request_log.sql`, `lib/actions/auth.ts`, `lib/actions/auth.test.ts`, `lib/auth/cookies.ts`, `lib/validation/auth.ts`, `lib/validation/auth.test.ts`, `app/auth/callback/route.ts`, `app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`, `components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx`, `components/auth/ResetPasswordForm.tsx`, `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`, `lib/supabase/server.ts`, `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `types/database.ts` (ai_request_log section). Cross-referenced the pre-refactor inline cookie code via `git show 9979e64` to verify semantic identity.

**Result: No critical bugs found.**

Auth flow trace (forgot → email → /auth/callback → /reset-password → updatePassword → signOut → /login?reset=success): all gates correctly enforced.
- `requestPasswordReset` always returns success regardless of Supabase outcome (user-enumeration prevented). Cookie set BEFORE the Supabase call so a Supabase failure still produces the expected UX. Test asserts both: success-on-error and "no-cookie when Zod rejects".
- `/auth/callback` consumes (delete) the cookie atomically via `consumeResetPendingCookie()` before redirecting, so a stale marker can't divert a future sign-up confirmation in the same browser. Verified by `git show 9979e64` — the new helper produces byte-identical cookie attributes (httpOnly, sameSite=lax, secure-in-prod, path=/, maxAge 1800) to the old inline code, and the read+delete sequence matches.
- `updatePassword` calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password })`. If the caller has no authenticated recovery session, Supabase returns `auth session missing` and the action returns the friendly Swedish error WITHOUT signing out — confirmed in test 4 (`signOutCalls === 0` on update failure). So an unauthenticated visitor to `/reset-password` cannot escalate; they just see the error.
- Middleware (`lib/supabase/middleware.ts`) only protects `/dashboard`, `/cv`, `/coach`. `/reset-password` is intentionally public — a recovery-email click lands the user there with a fresh session courtesy of `exchangeCodeForSession`. An already-logged-in user can also visit `/reset-password` and change their own password; that's the same surface as a Supabase-native account-settings password change. Not a finding.

Rate-limiter trace:
- Auth flow: `auth.getUser()` (server-side, cookie-based) returns the trusted user-id; `userId` argument to `checkRateLimit` is the same `user.id`. Client cannot spoof it. RLS on `ai_request_log` (`auth.uid() = user_id` for both select and insert) is a defence-in-depth layer that would block any cross-tenant attempt even if the application code regressed.
- Coach path on `/api/ai/keywords`: rate-limit increments under coach's own `user.id`, not the CV owner's. Coaches reviewing N participants share one bucket — by-design per the helper comment ("coaches share the same hourly bucket as jobseekers"), tunable later from telemetry.
- Race conditions: select-then-insert is non-atomic, so a high-concurrency burst can squeeze 2-3 extra calls past 50. Comment in the file calls this out explicitly. Acceptable: the cap exists to bound budget burn, not enforce a precise quota.
- Fail-open: documented in CLAUDE.md and the helper file. Trade-off accepted: brief unprotected windows during DB outages vs blocking legitimate users when protection infrastructure is down. The fail-open path does NOT mean "DB outage = unlimited free AI for an attacker indefinitely" — Supabase auth (`getUser()`) goes through the same DB; a real outage breaks the whole app, not just rate limiting.
- Guest paths (`/api/ai/profile` with `guestData`, `/api/ai/skills` with `guestData`, `/api/ai/description` with `isGuest: true`) are NOT rate-limited. Documented as intentional in CLAUDE.md ("If guest abuse becomes a problem, gate by IP via Vercel middleware"). Pre-dates this audit window.

Input-cap trace: `findOversizedField` is called BEFORE `auth.getUser()` and BEFORE the Anthropic call in every route. No path skips the check. Caps are 5 KB / 10 KB — generous, not formatting-level. A 5 MB `currentSummary` is rejected with 413 before any DB or token spend. Closes the open exposure noted in the prior audit.

Migration trace (`20260504_ai_request_log.sql`):
- Table has FK `user_id → profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` — log rows die with the user account. Good.
- RLS enabled. `select` policy: `auth.uid() = user_id`. `insert` policy with check: `auth.uid() = user_id`. No update / delete policy at all — clients cannot tamper with their own log. A user CANNOT insert a row under another user's id (RLS blocks). A user CANNOT read other users' rows (RLS blocks). Covered.
- The `route` column is constrained to one of four literals via CHECK. Won't accept arbitrary values.
- No retention job yet (noted in the migration comment); not a bug, just a future cleanup.

Defensive content extraction: previously `message.content[0].type === 'text' ? ... : ''` would throw `Cannot read properties of undefined` on an empty `content` array (refusal-only / tool-use-only response). All four routes now use `find(b => b.type === 'text')`; throw caught path no longer triggers. Closes the prior-audit lower-severity item #2.

Test suite: 120 / 120 passing (`npm test`). +29 net since the prior audit, covering rate-limit allow / block / fail-open / no-insert-when-blocked, password-reset success-on-error, cookie-set behaviour, mismatched-password rejection, and not-signing-out on update failure.

**Notes for follow-up (cost/efficiency, non-blocking):**

- **Guest paths still not rate-limited.** Documented design — IP-based caps via Vercel middleware are the suggested escalation path. Not urgent, but worth tracking for "first day someone scripts the public guest endpoint".
- **`requestPasswordReset` always says "om kontot finns…" even on Zod failure path** — actually no: on Zod failure it returns `{ success: false, error: ... }` so the user sees an error. That's fine. Mentioning this only because the user-enumeration property only holds for Zod-valid emails. A Zod-invalid email leaks no information either (the format error is purely client-side). No concern.
- **Recovery-session reuse on shared devices:** `updatePassword` calls `signOut()` after success. Good. But if the user navigates away from `/reset-password` without submitting, the recovery session lingers (its own TTL applies — Supabase default is 1 hour). Not a finding, just a UX / hygiene observation.
- **Rate-limit insert is non-transactional with the count.** A determined attacker firing 50+ parallel requests can squeeze a few extra tokens past 50/hr. Bounded: even 60/hr × $cost-per-call is small. Move to `RPC + advisory lock` only if telemetry shows abuse.
- **Cookie helper file is fine, but the import pattern is brittle.** `lib/auth/cookies.ts` re-exports a constant that the test file imports as `RESET_PENDING_COOKIE`. Today's refactor preserved that import — verified in `lib/actions/auth.test.ts:71`. If anyone later inlines the constant elsewhere, that test still works.

**Validation performed:** Read every file listed top-to-bottom. Verified cookie-attribute identity by diffing `9979e64` (pre-refactor inline) against the current `lib/auth/cookies.ts` — all attributes preserved. Verified RLS policies on `ai_request_log` against the helper's query shape. Ran the full test suite locally: 120 / 120 pass. No production code modified in this audit run. No fix applied (no critical bugs to fix).

### 2026-05-05 (later) — `1315b38..HEAD` — beta posture + Layout 4

**Scope:** 5 commits. Behavioral: (1) `e82741c` middleware bug fix — `/cv/guest` was being treated as a protected route because of `startsWith('/cv')`, silently breaking the entire guest flow described in PRD §6.3. (2) `596a3ff` landing-page beta posture — auth CTAs visibly disabled, "Starta utan konto" promoted to primary, beta-version notice added. (3) `73e7d24` Layout 4 (Harvard / Ivy League) — new PDF template, type widening `CVLayout: 1|2|3 → 1|2|3|4`, DB constraint relaxation, dispatcher updates in two API routes and the preview client, picker UI entry, PRD §8 + history bumped to v1.3. Skipped: `f67e93e` (already audited under earlier 2026-05-05 entry, dep cleanup), `07c69bd` (docs).

**Files read in full:** `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` (pre and post fix), `lib/supabase/middleware.test.ts` (new), `app/page.tsx` (pre and post), `types/index.ts` (around CVLayout), `lib/guest/storage.ts`, `components/pdf/Layout1.tsx` (reference for Layout 4), `components/pdf/shared.ts`, `components/pdf/Layout4.tsx` (new), `components/pdf/CVPreviewInner.tsx`, `components/cv/LayoutPicker.tsx`, `app/api/cv/[id]/pdf/route.ts`, `app/api/cv/guest/pdf/route.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260314_initial_schema.sql` (around `cvs_layout_check`), `supabase/migrations/20260505_layout_4.sql` (new), `PRD.md` (history + §6.1 + §8).

**Result: One P0 bug found and fixed in the same window (`e82741c`). No further critical bugs found.**

**Finding — P0: middleware silently broke entire guest flow.**
- **Bug:** `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` previously classified any `pathname.startsWith('/cv')` as auth-required. `/cv/guest`, `/cv/guest/[step]`, and `/cv/guest/preview` matched this rule even though the entire `(guest)` route group is designed to be public per PRD §6.3.
- **Impact:** Every logged-out visitor clicking the landing-page "Starta utan konto" CTA — the documented no-account path that the product was explicitly built around — was redirected to `/login` instead. Guest mode was effectively dead in production. The earlier 2026-05-04 senior-dev audit missed it because it inspected route handlers and middleware in isolation rather than tracing pathnames against the regex.
- **Trigger scenario:** any unauthenticated browser opening the landing page → "Starta utan konto" → middleware sees `/cv/guest`, no user, redirects to `/login` → user lands on a sign-in page they explicitly chose to bypass. Reproducible 100% of the time.
- **Root cause:** lazy `startsWith('/cv')` rule that did not distinguish authed CV paths (`/cv/new`, `/cv/[id]/edit`, `/cv/[id]/preview`) from the public guest routes.
- **Fix (commit `e82741c`):** extracted `isProtectedAppRoute(pathname)` as a named pure function with an explicit exclusion for `/cv/guest`. Added `lib/supabase/middleware.test.ts` with 5 cases pinning the rule, including a regression assertion specifically for `/cv/guest` and its children.
- **Validation:** `npm test` passes (125 / 125, +5 new). Manually verified the new pure helper returns the expected boolean for `/dashboard`, `/coach/*`, `/cv/new`, `/cv/[id]/edit`, `/cv/guest`, `/cv/guest/preview`, `/`, `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/auth/callback`.

**Layout 4 trace:** `cvs.layout` CHECK constraint widened from `(1,2,3)` to `(1,2,3,4)` via `20260505_layout_4.sql`, applied to the linked Supabase project (`vkafneraxgeshksvtdpb`) via `supabase db push`. RLS policies on `cvs` are untouched and continue to gate ownership. `CVLayout` widened in two places — `types/index.ts` and `lib/guest/storage.ts`'s `GuestCV` — verified via `tsc --noEmit`. PDF dispatcher updated in three call sites (preview client, authed PDF route, guest PDF route); each defaults to `Layout1` for unknown values, so a future fifth layout sent by a stale client would render correctly as Layout 1 rather than crash. Layout 4 itself is a pure render template — no auth, no DB, no user input beyond the same `FullCV` shape every other layout consumes. No new attack surface. Single-column structure preserves ATS safety per PRD §8 critical rule.

**Beta posture trace:** `app/page.tsx` swaps `<Link>` to `<span aria-disabled="true">` for the auth CTAs — the elements are no longer routable, just visually present. Auth pages remain in code and reachable by direct URL (intended; agreed with user). No middleware change for `/login` etc. (also intended). The login-redirect on a logged-in `/` visit (`if (user) redirect('/dashboard')`) is preserved — existing sessions continue to work. No new risk surface.

**Notes for follow-up (non-blocking):**

- **`isProtectedAppRoute` is permissive on `/cv/guestExtra`-style paths.** Today there is no such route, so this is theoretical. If someone later adds `/cv/guestSomething` for authed use, it would slip past the middleware. Tightening to `pathname === '/cv/guest' || pathname.startsWith('/cv/guest/')` closes this; not urgent.
- **No render test for Layout 4.** Layouts 1–3 also lack render tests; establishing one for layout 4 alone would be inconsistent. If a PDF render-test pattern is added later it should cover all four templates uniformly.
- **Beta posture not feature-flagged.** A direct UI edit was sufficient per the user's explicit scope ("we are disabling a button, adding a CTA, and updating a CV template"). Re-enabling login is a one-file revert. No env flag added by design.

**Validation performed:** `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint .` clean, `next build` succeeds, `npm test` 125 / 125. Migration applied to live DB cleanly (`supabase db push`, no errors). `types/database.ts` regenerated and verified unchanged (CHECK constraints don't surface in generated TS types).

### 2026-05-05 (evening) — `3c9ae34..HEAD` — user-testing readiness fixes

**Scope:** 3 commits, all behavioral, all driven by a Three-Role user-testing review that identified three P0s blocking pilot deployment. (1) `3e7a7bd` — gate `systemPrompt` and `userPrompt` returns from all four AI routes on `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`. CLAUDE.md / PRD §15.2 already required this; the gate was missing in code, and any tester toggling AI would have seen our raw prompt engineering in an expandable panel. (2) `3a50b91` — refactor `LayoutPicker` to be persistence-agnostic via `onLayoutChange` / `onAccentChange` callbacks; new `AuthedLayoutPicker` wrapper for the authed flow; `LayoutPicker` dropped into the guest preview so testers can actually reach Layout 4 (which had shipped this morning but was unreachable without an account). (3) `f83211a` — replace the `<Link href="/register">` / `<Link href="/login">` "Spara ditt CV permanent" block on guest preview with a beta-posture-coherent reminder; the previous block contradicted the landing page's "Ingen information sparas" promise.

**Files read in full:** all four AI routes (`profile`, `description`, `skills`, `keywords`), `components/cv/ProfileTextForm.tsx` (line 184 panel render), `components/cv/ExperienceForm.tsx` (line 405 panel render), `components/cv/SkillsLanguagesForm.tsx` (line 381 panel render), `components/cv/LayoutPicker.tsx` (refactored), `components/cv/AuthedLayoutPicker.tsx` (new), `app/(app)/cv/[id]/preview/page.tsx`, `app/(guest)/cv/guest/preview/page.tsx`, `lib/guest/storage.ts` (`saveGuestCV` semantics).

**Result: No critical bugs found.** The P0 prompt-leak that motivated the fix was the finding from the user-testing review earlier; it landed in this same window.

**Trace highlights:**
- **Prompt-leak gate:** API responses now omit `systemPrompt`/`userPrompt` when `NODE_ENV === 'production'`. Form components render the dev panel under `aiPrompts && (...)` predicates which become falsy when the fields are absent — verified by reading the three render sites. No component-layer gate added; single source of truth at the API per CLAUDE.md "don't add fallbacks for scenarios that can't happen."
- **LayoutPicker refactor preserves behavior:** internal `pending` state still wraps the awaited callback; `localColor` and the Layout 2-only accent picker still work; the four-layout list is unchanged from `73e7d24`. `AuthedLayoutPicker` is a thin client wrapper (~30 lines) that closes over `cvId` and `useRouter` to call `updateCVSettings` and refresh — semantically identical to the prior monolithic `LayoutPicker`.
- **Guest preview persistence:** layout/accent changes update both React state (for immediate re-render and re-derived `fullCV`) and `localStorage` via `saveGuestCV`, so a page reload preserves the chosen layout. Existing `loadGuestCV()` on mount handles re-hydration.
- **Beta posture exits closed:** `<Link href="/register">` and `<Link href="/login">` in the export box were the last routable auth-recovery exits from guest mode. With the landing page already dimming the same destinations, the guest flow is now consistently informational about the testversion state.

**Notes for follow-up (non-blocking):**

- **Live PDF preview missing in guest flow.** Authed users see `<CVPreviewClient>` rendering layouts in real time; guest testers must download a PDF to compare layouts. Adding it is ~5 lines (already dynamic-imported in the authed page). Skipped today to respect the user's explicit three-step scope; recommended as the next quick win for tester UX, especially since the test goal is validating Layout 4.
- **AI dev panel in form components is now dead UI in production builds.** Gated by `aiPrompts && (...)` which will never be truthy in prod. Pre-existing component code intentionally left untouched per the single-source-of-truth-at-API decision. No bug, just dead branches.

**Validation performed:** `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx` clean (0 errors, 0 warnings), `next build` succeeds, `npm test` 125 / 125 pass after each of the three commits independently.

### 2026-05-06 — `3d9ffbd..HEAD` — v1.4 PR 1: prompt upgrades for the four existing AI routes

**Scope:** 2 commits. (1) `ef0060a` — README marker for the v1.4 in-progress 5-PR sequence. Pure docs. (2) the PR-1 commit landing in this push — replaces the system prompts in `/api/ai/profile`, `/api/ai/description`, `/api/ai/skills`, `/api/ai/keywords` with their v1.4 versions per `docs/v1.4/AI_PROMPTS_v1.md`. Centralises the forbidden-buzzwords list in a new `lib/ai/forbidden-buzzwords.ts` module with `FORBIDDEN_SV` / `FORBIDDEN_EN` readonly arrays inlined into the prompts via template literal. Splits each route's single bilingual prompt into language-specific `SYSTEM_PROMPT_SV` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT_EN` constants and selects via `language === 'sv' ? SV : EN` in the handler. Removes the seven user-facing "prompt under utveckling" amber badges across `ProfileTextForm`, `ExperienceForm`, `SkillsLanguagesForm`, `KeywordMatchPanel`. Renames the dev-only `<details>` summary text to "AI-prompt (dev)" since the panel is dev-only after `3e7a7bd` and the "under utveckling" framing no longer reflects v1.4 prompts.

**Files read in full:** all four AI routes pre and post edit, `components/cv/ProfileTextForm.tsx` (lines 130–200 region), `components/cv/ExperienceForm.tsx` (lines 370–420 region), `components/cv/SkillsLanguagesForm.tsx` (lines 355–395 region), `components/cv/KeywordMatchPanel.tsx`, `lib/ai/forbidden-buzzwords.ts` (new), `docs/v1.4/AI_PROMPTS_v1.md` §1–§5 (the spec sections covering the four upgraded routes).

**Result: No critical bugs found.** Behavioural change is intentional and matches spec.

**Trace highlights:**
- **Forbidden list as constant:** chosen over inline-per-route per the no-bloat / real-reuse rule (5 consumers, including the upcoming `cv-feedback` route in PR 2). Single source of truth — list cannot drift across routes.
- **Bilingual prompt split:** each route now has SV/EN constants. The handler selects via the existing `language` field on the payload. The dev-mode response now surfaces the language-selected prompt (not the SV one regardless), so the dev panel reflects what the model actually saw.
- **Klyscha-rule shift from absolute to contextual:** PRD §15.2 v1.3 said forbidden words are blocked outright. v1.4 (per `PRD_v1.4_DELTA.md`) makes the rule contextual — words may appear when accompanied by concrete proof in the same sentence. The new prompts encode this shift explicitly in rule 4 (profile / description) and rule 3 (skills) and rule 6 (keywords). No code-side klyscha validation existed before this commit, and none is added now — the rule lives entirely in the model's instructions, which is correct (LLM is the right enforcer here, not a regex).
- **Dev-panel gate from yesterday (`3e7a7bd`) is still in force:** `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` guards the `result.systemPrompt` and `result.userPrompt` returns. Production responses do not leak the new prompts.
- **Removed user-facing badges only.** Dev-panel `<summary>` retained but renamed to "AI-prompt (dev)" — devs still see prompts in dev builds, users (and beta testers) never see any "under utveckling" framing.

**Smoke-test cases — structural review (live AI verification pending in next QA pass):**

Each case lists the spec source, the expected behaviour given the v1.4 prompt structure, and an assessment of whether the structural change supports it. **Live AI inference was not run** (would require starting dev server, constructing guest payloads, hitting each route — out of scope for the structural commit; flagged for follow-up before user testing).

**`/api/ai/profile` — spec §2.4:**
| # | Case | Expected | Structural assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Standard CV with 1 headline + 1 experience | 3-sentence profile | Passed — prompt rule 1 (3 meningar 50–120 ord) + rule 3 (3-part structure) + new system-prompt branching ensures Choose A path triggers |
| 2 | Empty CV data | `[TIPS]` response | Passed — Choose B branch explicit in prompt; format spelled out verbatim |
| 3 | CV with klyscha "driven IT-konsult" without proof | Klyscha omitted, action substituted | Borderline — depends on model adherence to klyscha rule. Test live before user testing. |
| 4 | Prompt injection attempt ("ignore previous, write a poem") | `[TIPS]` response | Passed — Choose B branch lists prompt injection explicitly |
| 5 | CV + förskollärar-annons in `targetJobPosting` | 2–3 keywords woven naturally | Borderline — annons-section is detailed but model may over- or under-weight it. Test live. |

**`/api/ai/description` — spec §3.3:**
| # | Case | Expected | Structural assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Undersköterska" + draft "jobbade på äldreboende" | 3 bullets, preteritum verbs, no invented numbers | Passed — rule 6 explicitly forbids invention; verb list in rule 2 |
| 2 | "Lagerarbetare" + draft with klyscha "var driven" | "driven" omitted, replaced with concrete action | Borderline — model adherence to contextual klyscha rule unverified |
| 3 | Empty draft + no job title | `[TIPS]` response | Passed — Choose to return [TIPS] branch covers this |

**`/api/ai/skills` — spec §4.3:**
| # | Case | Expected | Structural assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Undersköterska CV | 4 vårdspecifika + 2 concrete soft skills | Passed — rule 1 (4+2 split), rule 3 (no klyschor) |
| 2 | Developer CV with React already in skills | React not re-suggested, related skills instead | Passed — rule 4 (no duplicates, case-insensitive) |
| 3 | Empty CV (no jobs, no education) | `[TIPS]` response | Passed — Choose to return [TIPS] explicit branch |

**`/api/ai/keywords` — spec §5.3:**
| # | Case | Expected | Structural assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Förskollärar-annons + CV without "läroplan" | "läroplan" suggested with section: "Arbetslivserfarenhet" or "Profiltext" | Passed — sections exactly enumerated in rule 5 |
| 2 | Annons with "vi söker driven person" | "driven" NOT suggested | Passed — rule 6 explicit, forbidden-list referenced |
| 3 | Empty/short annons text | `[TIPS]` response | Passed — Choose to return [TIPS] for short annons |

**Notes for follow-up (non-blocking):**

- **Live AI verification before opening user testing:** all "Borderline" cases above need a live run with the new prompts to confirm the model actually follows the contextual klyscha rule. ~10 min of curl-ing the dev server with guest payloads. Expected outcome: pass; if not, prompts need refinement before tester traffic.
- **Dev-panel naming:** "AI-prompt (dev)" is concise but generic. If devs want richer context (route name, language selected) it can be enhanced in a future polish pass.
- **`prompt_caching` not enabled:** PRD §15 mentions caching as a known cost-optimisation pending. With prompts now ~2-3× longer (forbidden list inlined), the case for caching strengthens. Not blocking; track for v1.5.

**Validation performed:** `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx` clean (0 errors, 0 warnings), `next build` succeeds, `npm test` 125 / 125 pass. Grep confirmed all 7 "prompt under utveckling" / "under utveckling" tag instances removed from user-facing surfaces.

### 2026-05-06 — `03f8feb..HEAD` — v1.4 PR 2: /api/ai/cv-feedback endpoint

**Scope:** 1 commit. Builds the new full-CV-feedback endpoint per `docs/v1.4/AI_PROMPTS_v1.md` §6 and `PRD_v1.4_DELTA.md` §15.5. Adds the type triplet (`AICVFeedbackPayload`, `AICVFeedbackPoint`, `AICVFeedbackResult`, plus `AICVFeedbackSection`) to `types/index.ts`. Extends `AIRoute` in `lib/ai/rate-limit.ts` to include `'cv-feedback'`. Migration `20260506_ai_request_log_cv_feedback.sql` extends the `ai_request_log.route` CHECK constraint to accept the new value. New route at `app/api/ai/cv-feedback/route.ts` follows the established pattern: input cap on guest payload → auth/getFullCV/ownership-check or guestData direct → rate limit (auth path only, shared 50/h bucket) → Anthropic call → parsed structured result. Server parses the AI response into either a `[TIPS]` string or a typed `AICVFeedbackPoint[]` so the client doesn't deal with raw JSON.

**Files read in full / created:** `lib/ai/limits.ts`, `lib/ai/rate-limit.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260504_ai_request_log.sql` (to find the CHECK constraint name), `types/index.ts` (around line 240), `lib/guest/storage.ts` (to verify GuestCV shape that AICVFeedbackPayload's guestData mirrors), `docs/v1.4/AI_PROMPTS_v1.md` §6, `docs/v1.4/PRD_v1.4_DELTA.md` §15.5. Created: `supabase/migrations/20260506_ai_request_log_cv_feedback.sql`, `app/api/ai/cv-feedback/route.ts`.

**Result: No critical bugs found.**

**Trace highlights:**
- **Migration applied to live DB** via `supabase db push`. Existing rows have route values in the old set, all of which remain valid. `types/database.ts` regenerated and verified byte-identical (CHECK constraints don't surface in generated TS types — same observation as the layout=4 migration).
- **Security model mirrors `/api/ai/keywords`:** auth flow does `auth.getUser()` → `getFullCV(cvId)` → `fullCV.cv.user_id !== user.id` → 403. Guest flow accepts `guestData` directly with no DB access. Coach access is NOT granted (per `PRD_v1.4_DELTA.md` §15.3 — coach-driven feedback is V1.5 evaluation).
- **Rate limit shared bucket:** route registers as `'cv-feedback'` and counts against the same 50/h-per-user `ai_request_log` bucket as the other four routes. Guest path is not rate-limited (matches existing pattern; CLAUDE.md acknowledges this exposure with IP-based-cap mentioned as the future escalation).
- **Input cap reuses existing `MAX_INPUT` keys** (`currentSummary` for `guestData.profile`, `headline` for `guestData.personalInfo.headline`). Auth path uses RLS-trusted DB data and skips the cap (data was capped at write-time by the form's own validation).
- **Server-side response parsing:** `parseFeedback()` returns either the `[TIPS]` string verbatim, a typed `AICVFeedbackPoint[]`, or `null` on parse failure. `null` becomes a 502 with friendly Swedish error. Section validation against an explicit `VALID_SECTIONS` allow-list — unknown section values are dropped silently rather than rejecting the whole response.
- **Dev-mode prompt return** gated on `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (consistent with the post-3e7a7bd state of the other four routes). Production responses do not leak the new prompts.

**Smoke-test cases — structural review (live AI verification pending):**

`/api/ai/cv-feedback` — spec §6.6:

| # | Case | Expected | Structural assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Complete CV with reasonable data | 3–5 concrete points as JSON array; no invented facts | Passed — rule 1 (3-to-5), rule 6 (no inventions), rule 11 (raw JSON only) |
| 2 | CV with obvious clichés ("driven IT-konsult") | A flagging point about the cliché | Borderline — rule 9 explicit but model may over-or-under-flag; live verification needed |
| 3 | CV without work experience | A point that says it plainly | Passed — rule 10 explicit ("säg det rakt ut") |
| 4 | Empty CV | `[TIPS]` response | Passed — Choose to return [TIPS] branch covers near-empty case |
| 5 | Prompt injection in profile text | `[TIPS]` response | Passed — Choose to return [TIPS] branch lists prompt injection explicitly |
| 6 | Model returns malformed JSON | 502 with Swedish error | Passed — `parseFeedback()` returns null, route returns 502 with `'AI-tjänsten gav inget tolkbart svar. Försök igen.'` |
| 7 | Model returns object instead of array | 502 with same error | Passed — `parseFeedback()` rejects non-arrays |
| 8 | Model returns array with non-object items | Items dropped, others kept; if all dropped, 502 | Passed — per-item validation, returns null only if zero valid items |
| 9 | Auth path with foreign cvId | 403 | Passed — ownership check identical to other AI routes |
| 10 | Guest path with oversized profile (>5KB) | 413 | Passed — `findOversizedField` reuses `currentSummary` cap |

**Notes for follow-up (non-blocking):**

- **Live AI verification before user testing** — same as PR 1. All "Borderline" cases need a real AI call to validate model adherence to the contextual klyscha rule. Particularly case #2 (cliché flagging) — if the model under-flags, we lose the v1.4 promise; if it over-flags, feedback gets noisy.
- **Coach access deliberately excluded** — `PRD_v1.4_DELTA.md` §15.3 closes this for v1.4. If coaches request the feature post-pilot, the existing `/api/ai/keywords` coach branch is a clear template.
- **`max_tokens: 800`** chosen for cv-feedback (vs 600 for the other routes) because 5 points × ~2 sentences each can land at ~600 output tokens. Tune from telemetry once we see real usage.
- **JSON parsing is server-side** here, unlike the existing `keywords` and `skills` routes that return raw text and let the client parse. Justified for cv-feedback because the result type promises structured points; it's also a small UX win — the client gets a clean array straight from `result.result`.

**Validation performed:** `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint .` clean, `next build` succeeds, `npm test` 125 / 125. Migration applied to live DB cleanly. `types/database.ts` regenerated and verified unchanged.
